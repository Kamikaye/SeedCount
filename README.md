# SeedCount
Counting seeds from mobile photos and scans

This ImageJ FIJI macro can be used to count seeds (or any darker-than-background objects) on a white surface (a sheet of paper). 

v1 just counts the objects in the picture, or inside a rectangular selection. 

v2 can count objects and measure some parameters like length, diamater, area and perimeter. 

v3 is planned to be able to analyze seed colors. 

Don't hestitate to contact me if you have any questions.
